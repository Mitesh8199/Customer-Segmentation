# Customer-Segmentation

## What is Customer Segmentation?</br>
Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.</br>


In this project I've used RFM Modelling and K-Means Clustering to segregate the customers according to their loyalty.</br>
According to the RFMScores I've made 4 loyalty bands named 'Platinum','Gold','Silver','Bronze'.</br>
After which using K-Means Clustering all these customers are distributed in the clusters.</br>
The Value of K is choosen with the help of Elbow Method</br>



## What is RFM Modelling?</br>
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.</br>
### Recency: The Freshness of the customer avtivity, be it purchases or visits.
### Frequency: The frequency of the customer transactions or visits.
### Monetary: The intention of customer to spend or purchasing power of customer.
